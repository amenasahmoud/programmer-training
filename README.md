# Programmer Training

This is designed for FRC team 1678, but anyone is welcome to use it to learn about Python, C++, the Linux terminal, and more stuff.

### How the training is structured for our team
**[General]({{ "/general" | absolute_url }}):** This is where you start your basic Python training. After a few months, join either app or robot programming.

**[Robot]({{ "/robot" | absolute_url }}):** This is the subteam that programs the robot. This involves programming autonomous routines, controllers, tests, and computer vision (sometimes).

**[App]({{ "/app" | absolute_url }}):** This is the subteam that creates and runs the scouting app. That includes doing calculations with the server (Python), making the app for tablets (Swift), and managing the database.

----
Once this is done, I plan to [transfer ownership](https://help.github.com/articles/about-repository-transfers/) of this repository to [frc1678](https://github.com/frc1678).
