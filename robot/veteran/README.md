#Veteran Robot Programmer Training

In the summer and offseason of 2018-2019, we will be taking steps to ensure that our second-year programmers (congrats! You made it through build season!) will be able to effectively manage the entire codebase by themselves - essentially, the sum of this second-year training should be enough to bring the programmers up to the level needed to fully contribute to the robot programming codebase. This training will involve several areas, including greater depth of understanding in C++ and Python programming as well as specific knowledge of the Linux operating system, the Bazel build system, and WPILib and the FRC control system.

Every programmer is not expected to understand all of the below topics in complete detail. Everyone should still have some basic familiarity with each of the topics: bold entries below indicate topics that all veteran programmers should understand. Each programmer should also study in depth two or three other topics with the expectation that they will become one of the team’s "experts” on that topic.

This training will mostly involve the self-paced use of resources linked below. There may also be some formal lectures or exercises depending on what the programmers are having trouble with.
